    <p>I started taking jewelry in my freshman year of highschool and ever since that year I have taken all of the classes that could be correlated with it. I fell in love with jewelry because it was
    a way for me to take two-dimensional art and convert it into a 3D object that people could wear. In the first few years of the class, there was not anything to write home about. This was an outlet that
    helped me try something that i would never think about doing. Having the support from the teachers really helped me put myself out there and maybe turn some heads. This truly paid off
    when I won the 3D art award for Jeffco and was given the chance to work under a professional jeweler in evergreen. But I would like to share with you the work that i am really proud of from my
    senyour year. Along with some of the designs that drew but never had the chance to make. So while looking at my scetches try clicking them to see the final product of the jewelry.</p>

    <p>This ring is one that I spent a lot of time on because I wanted this to look the best it could. The final product of the ring is the first image on the page. My thought process
    behind making this is because I wanted to make a ring that could resemble something that people might use has a proposal ring or a wedding ring. And I wanted to have it be something that wasn't
    very traditional for a ring. So I used reticulated silver which is silver that is infused with tin, so when it is heated it will create a ripple effect with the metal. And what I did to make them more
    prominent I used architecture black paint to make it so everything will just pop. The effect with the medal made the gem on top just pop that much more. For the design at the bottom,
    you can see the many lines that look very similar. That is because when I talked to a professional jeweler he said to draw the same like 50 times because they will not all look the same and because
    of this you will find the one line that you will fall in love with. When making jewelry you may not think of it but every little line can make the difference to being what you want and something
    that you soldered together and you are not that proud of. Some troubles that I ran into are when setting the device to hold the stone. Because I reticulated the silver before I added that on so the
    devise had very few contact points so when I attached it I used a lot of solder so it would stay in place. The stone that was used is called aqua marene.</p>
    <img src="jewly_img/eye_flower.jpg" alt="ring_sketch" width="632" height="783.5" class="fL" id="eyeFlower" onclick="eyeFlower()" value="Change Image">
    <p>This project is called eye flower, this was the first project that i have done that includes apoxie integrated into a project. the idea is for the epoxy held in place with a wire that is shaped like
    a square where the most wire is a cylinder. This was to make it so the epoxy would stay in place. The hole flower would be placed on a piece of metal that resembled an eye with a teardrop to represent
    that making beauty visible will cause pain for the one who is trying to achieve this. And I really felt this when I was trying to create this. This project created more issues than I would like to
    admit. When I was making this I made the wire frame and eye separately because it was easier this way, I got a bit too ambitious when it came to laying the epoxy. I added red acrylic paint to
    in an attempt to make it resemble a rose, looking back at it I should have laid the epoxie and then scraped off the excess on the top so I could keep the shiny sheen on the front of the project. But
    Instead what I did was put the epoxy and have it overflow so I could use my sad paper and other tools to make it look more natural and then polish with the polishing wheels we have. When i did
    this and went to polish I discovered that you can't polish epoxie with polishing wheels that i had available to me. The final project sadly did not have the curves in the flower that i had hoped
    for, nor did it have the tear drop on the bace of the platform. So once I learned this I had to put a small amount of the same mixture on top to give it that shiny look on top. Even though the
    project came out well I would have done a few things differently if I were to ever do it again.</p>
    <img src="jewly_img/secret_of_the_stone.jpg" alt="secret_of_the_stone_sketch" width="632" height="783.5" class="fR" id="sStone" onclick="sStone()" value="Change Image">
    <p>This project I like to call "The power within the stone", this project like many others have an idea behind it. The reasoning behind this is because for the class I had to have all of
    my projects fall under an overarching idea and the idea that I chose was the world around us. This project is supposed to symbolize that we as humans will destroy the sone to find the secrets that
    are beneath them. The outside of the ring is to look like a stone that was destroyed by humans and is highlighted by the inlay stones. While the inside of the ring had elvish letters that spell out
    "the power in the stone". This is what we are trying to find but while the research for looking for it followed with the destruction of the information that we are trying to look for. The project
    was yet another one that was me trying to do something new. This was my first experience with casting, I thought this was a good idea because the project has a lot of intricate lines that would require much
    more work if I were to not use casting. When setting up for casting one must create the ring out of wax to make a negative for the project. There were two iterations for the wax mold because then
    i was creating the first one the ring broke so it became unusable for the casting. In the second iteration, I was much more careful when I was doing each line and curve. once that was finished
    Another problem arose, when setting the mold in the cast there is a wax stick that has to be placed so you can poar the mettle into the mold. I was able to make the rod stick constantly. But the
    the problem arose when I poured in the substance and started hitting it to have the air bubbles rise. When I would do this the wax ring would always detach and I would have to rewatch it to a new rod
    and then try the casting again. After about three or four tries it worked so then we worked on the casting process and removed the metal ring(i can't remember the exact mettle that I used).
    After cleaning up the mold it was time to lay all of the inlay stones. How I did this was I would have the ring on material and would set each singular stone in the grove and once I had a
    large enough section I would add super glue to make it stay in place. This took me several class periods to complete but I believe the final product came out very nice.</p>

    <p>This project I like to call "chains of our broken world", This was the second project that was made my senior year at high school. The price is supposed to depict our planet earth that is being taken
    over by the chains of technology. The lightning bolts depict our world being overrun by the electronics that we all use every day. With the chains being what is holding us down and trapped unable
    to break free. The power symbol is unable to see when looking at it face on but when you look at the problem at a different angle you can see that the solution is as easy as pressing the power
    button to disconnect. Creating the project was not one to see as easy, each separate piece was cut out separately and for some of them, I made them two layers. As for the overall world, peace is
    two of the same material and size. This was accomplished by cutting everything that I needed cut out on the top later then soldered that piece onto an uncut piece of metal so once that was completed
    I had to cut out the pieces that i had already done with the top piece to make it look seamless. This party alone created a lot of headache because one that was done came to the inlaying. This
    is where you have two metals of different varieties and have one fit into a negative of the other, such as fitting two pieces of a puzzle. The issue was when I was doing this I had to make several
    iterations to each of the inlay pieces because when I made them there was one section that fit really nicely but there were spots that I cut and filed too much off and it made it come out very poar.
    Once all of that was done and finished I started work on the power button that is only visible from the bottom. The two pieces only need two iterations because all I need to do was make the
    pice and then from there have them slide into the holes that were previously created. after I got the first one to fit in nicely I realized that all of the filings I did to make it fit, looked
    rugged to the extent that I didn't want that to be a part of my project. So instead what I did was took the main piece and filed the inside out to make sure there were no imperfections so a piece of
    metacould slide in very nicely.</p>

    <p>All around us we can see that we are all divided may that be by race or age but this piece I call "society" but I wanted to focus on the idea of the division because of income. A periemend in my
    opinyon is the best way to look at this part of our world. The bottom layer is to depict the lower class, with it being the section that is out of place because it is different, rugged, pore. This is
    the base and largest part of the experiment because of the number of people without a home, without a job, or worse. Next is the middle class, much cleaner than the lower class but still not polished.
    They are the people who have enough money to get by and live happy lives, which there are enough people here but less than the lower class but smaller than the upper class. and at the top is the
    people who make the most and are a part of the upper class, they are clean well kept, and very much polished. Even though we are all different we are connected and a little swing will affect us all. But
    overall from the back behind closed doors away from people and everything we are all the same, not polished, rugged, and we have our own ideas of being happy. This is what I was trying to get across
    with this project. I used brass as the top layer, nickel for the middle, and reticulated silver as the bottom. The reason behind each of the different metals, the silver is naturally rough but only
    on the front, the back is smoother and much cleaner. After seeing this I made the comment to my teacher that this is a great example for people in our society. This comment sparked the idea for the project
    you see in front of you. The hardest part for me to accomplish this project was that this was my first experience with hinges. I am always up for a challenge so I wanted the hinges to be at an angle
    to keep the idea of the periemend. My teacher warned me that this was not going to be easy but I still wanted to make the piece look better than something simple. In the end, I believe that all the work
    that I did pay off very well.</p>
    <img src="jewly_img/protection.jpg" alt="sesioty_sketch" width="632" height="783.5" class="fL" id="prot" onclick="prot()" value="Change Image">
    <p>Protecting what is valuable and important to you, is the mindset of most people. This piece was not meant to be worn but to be a reminder that whenever you can find a way to protect that what is
    valuable to you because that is what we are taught. Anything can get past your protective wall that you built no matter what you do but with that damage, you can use it to be the foundation for what can
    hold what is important to you. Being able to recover from what has hurt you is what all of us have gone through and recovered from. The sheer size of the project made it really hard for me to achieve what
    I had originally designed. In the final project there were two pieces of metal that were roughly the same size. My plan was to use three of them so the diameter would be approximately 5.6 inches. That was
    the plan but after I was able to connect only two pieces together I realized, to achieve the size that I desired it would require so much more machines than what I had available to me. The idea behind the
    nails was that I wanted to use something that depicted pain and somewhat torcher. Using that idea to show people that even though it may hurt there is always a way to make this beautiful.</p>
