    <h2 id="About">About the project</h2>
    <p>This project was one that opened my eyes to the world of development. When i was working on my Savior of middlemist my team only consisteed of me and one other person in the final year. So becasue of theis my teacher made it prominent that because of This
    the project was usless to work on so i was made to move to a difrent project that was already in development. This project was one that was in a launge thatr i have not used to the extent that i was used to, that being "unity". The premis
    of the game was a boy who was rejected by his parents and a backer gives him some matched. The said matched created a creature witch asists him on his juneys.</p>
